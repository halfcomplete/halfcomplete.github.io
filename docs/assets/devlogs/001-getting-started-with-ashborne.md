Today marks the beginning of the Ashborne project. This interactive narrative experience has been on my mind for months, and I'm finally ready to bring it to life.

## The Vision

Ashborne is an interactive fiction project built using C#, Blazor, and the Ink scripting language. The goal is to create an immersive narrative experience that combines traditional storytelling with dynamic, player-driven choices.

## Tech Stack Decisions

Choosing the right tools is crucial for any project. Here's what I'm working with:

- **C#** - The backbone of the application logic
- **Blazor** - For building the interactive web UI
- **Ink** - A powerful narrative scripting language by Inkle

## Initial Setup

The first step was setting up the project structure. I wanted something modular and easy to maintain as the project grows. Here's a quick overview of the architecture:

```
Ashborne/
├── src/
│   ├── Core/
│   ├── Narrative/
│   └── UI/
├── stories/
└── tests/
```

## What's Next

In the next devlog, I'll dive into the narrative engine implementation and how Ink integrates with the Blazor frontend. Stay tuned!
